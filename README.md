**alt-tab-macos** brings the power of Windows "alt-tab" window switcher to macOS.

# How to use

* Press `‚å• option` + `‚á• tab` to shows the thumbnails
* Hold `‚å• option` and press `‚á• tab` to select the next thumbnail
* Hold `‚å• option` and press `‚áß shift` + `‚á• tab` to select the previous thumbnail
* Release `‚å• option` to switch focus to the window

**Extra:**

* You hover and click with the `üñ±Ô∏è mouse`
* You cycle with `‚á¶ left arrow` and `‚á® right arrow`
* You can cancel with `‚éã escape`

# Configuration

* Change the shortcut key, switch to a Windows theme, and more, using the Preferences window
* If you like scriptable/portable configuration, you can edit `~/Library/Preferences/alt-tab-macos.json`

# Alternatives

Before building my own app, I looked around at similar apps. However, none was completely satisfactory so I rolled my own. Also the almost-good-enough apps are not open-source.

* [HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch) and [HyperDock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock)  
  Free but closed-source. Things I would change: thumbnails are too small, app icon is on top of the thumbnail
* [Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/) and [Context](https://contexts.co/)  
  10-15$. Focus on text instead of thumbnails
* Built-in [MissionControl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_(macOS\))  
  No keyboard support
* Command-tab  
  Only see apps, not windows (note: can press down to see window of selected app)
* Command-`  
  Cycles through tabs and windows, but only of the same app. No direct access; only cycling
